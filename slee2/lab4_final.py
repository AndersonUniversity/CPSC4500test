Goal is to Write a Python module to verify that the Magic 1089 trick is indeed true.
This program should:
Have a function that takes a number as an argument and verifies that the digits are in decreasing order, returning True
if they are and False if not.
The digits must be strictly decreasing, since the Magic 1089 trick does not work for numbers like 988, where two digits
are equal.
# One way to do this is to convert the number to a string using the str() function, then use a for loop to compare
neighboring characters.
Have a function that takes a number as an argument. If the number is three digits, and the digits are in decreasing
order, then the function should perform the above calculations and return the result (which should be 1089) as an integer.
Hint: Again, converting the number to a string can help. For example, you can easily reverse a string using the slice
operator [::-1]. Youâ€™ll need to convert back to an integer before adding or subtracting.
test every number in the list (from step 1) using this function, outputting the results as part of your unit test.
Hint: I found 120 numbers that fit the criteria, and all had a result of 1089.
